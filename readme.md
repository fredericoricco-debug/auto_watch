# Setup

- You need qBittorrent for this to work.
- Install it and then follow the next steps:
  - Open the settings and setup the web UI.
  - Enable the web UI, choose a port, and set a username and password.
  - Update the config file to store this combination of username and password, as well as the port chosen.
  - Once this is done, login to the local web UI through your localhost:port.
- Once this is done you should be ready to start using auto_watch.
